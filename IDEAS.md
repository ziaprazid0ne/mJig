### BUGS ###

- When resizing the window, seemingly when shrinking the window horizontaly, the logo box seems to be misscalculating the vertical center, and i see    flashes of the box being redrawn above and below whare it should be. this behavior doe not happen when expanding the windo in either axis. but is consitnantly happening when shrinking the window on the horizonal axis.

- after resizing the window, frequently, but not every time, the button click detection stops working. it is fixed by pressing one of th hotkeys. we need to fix whats causing that, and additionaly add some kind of routine after window resize that ensures button click detection in the console is in a working state.
