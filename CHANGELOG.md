## [Latest] - Unreleased

Changes since last commit (cee9bf8 - "VT100 flicker-free rendering, clickable buttons via PeekConsoleInput, buffered frame output"):

### Added
- **`Show-StartupScreen` function** - Initial "Initializing..." loading screen shown at script start (skipped in `-DebugMode` and `-Output hidden`). Runs before VT100 is fully set up so it uses `Write-Host`. Shows a decorative box with "mJig is starting up..." messaging.
- **`Show-StartupComplete` function** - "Initialization Complete" screen shown after startup. Displays current parameters in a box. Behavior depends on whether any parameters were passed: no params → "Press any key to continue" (waits indefinitely); params passed → 7-second auto-continue countdown with "any key to skip". Includes `drawCompleteScreen` and `drainWakeKeys` nested helpers and calls `Invoke-ResizeHandler` when the window is resized while the screen is displayed.
- **`Invoke-ResizeHandler` function** - Unified, blocking resize handler usable from any context after initialization (startup screens, main loop, hidden mode). Draws the resize logo in normal mode or clears to blank in hidden mode. Polls at 1ms intervals, redraws on every size change, clears every 50 redraws to prevent artifact buildup. Exits only when the window has been stable for `$ResizeThrottleMs` (1500ms) **and** LMB is released. Always calls `Restore-ConsoleInputMode` and `Send-ResizeExitWakeKey` on exit. Returns the final stable `[System.Management.Automation.Host.Size]` object.
- **`drainWakeKeys` nested helper** (inside `Show-StartupComplete`) - Drains the console input buffer after `Invoke-ResizeHandler` returns. Reads and discards `VK_RMENU` (keycode 165, the synthetic wake key injected by `Send-ResizeExitWakeKey`) while returning `$true` if any real (non-wake) key was consumed. Used to prevent the injected wake key from falsely dismissing the welcome screen as if the user pressed a real key.
- **`Write-ButtonImmediate` function** - New helper that renders a single menu button at specified colors and flushes immediately. Used for instant press/release visual feedback without waiting for the next full frame render. Supports both emoji-pipe format (format 0) and text-only formats (format 1/2). Stored in bounds entries as `displayText` and `format`.
- **Per-button color properties in `$script:MenuItemsBounds`** - Every bounds entry now includes `fg`, `bg`, `hotkeyFg`, `onClickFg`, `onClickBg`, `onClickHotkeyFg`. Applies to all four build sites: regular menu items, quit button, hidden `(h)` button, and the clear-on-hide path.
- **Onclick color theme variables** - `$script:MenuButtonOnClickBg` (`"DarkCyan"`), `$script:MenuButtonOnClickFg` (`"Black"`), `$script:MenuButtonOnClickHotkey` (`"Black"`) added to the theme colors section as defaults for the pressed button state.
- **Button press state tracking variables** - `$script:PressedMenuButton` (hotkey of button currently held), `$script:ButtonClickedAt` (timestamp of confirmed UP-over-button click), `$script:PendingDialogCheck` (flag for render loop to decide immediate vs. persistent color restore), `$script:LButtonWasDown` (previous LMB console state for UP-transition detection).

### Changed
- **All resize detection paths now route through `Invoke-ResizeHandler`** - The previous three independent resize implementations (main wait loop tight redraw loop + outer stability check, hidden-mode polling loop, and welcome screen simple redraw) have all been replaced with calls to `Invoke-ResizeHandler`. The function provides consistent resize behavior (logo, stability wait, LMB gate, input mode restore, wake key) everywhere the window can be resized.
- **`$oldWindowSize` and `$OldBufferSize` initialized before main loop** - Both variables are set to the current window/buffer size immediately before the `:process while ($true)` loop starts. Previously they were `$null` at first iteration, causing `$windowSizeChanged = $true` unconditionally and triggering a spurious resize screen on every startup.
- **Second (outside-wait-loop) resize detection block rewritten** - The per-iteration resize check that runs after the wait loop (guarded by `if (-not $forceRedraw)`) was still using the old detect-pending-draw-stability pattern. Replaced with a simple `Invoke-ResizeHandler` call on actual size change, with text-zoom detection retained.
- **Welcome screen keypress detection hardened against injected wake keys** - The `while (-not $Host.UI.RawUI.KeyAvailable)` pattern replaced with an explicit `$keyPressed` flag loop. `KeyAvailable` + `ReadKey` calls filter out `VK_RMENU` (165) and only set `$keyPressed = $true` on genuine key presses. The countdown loop uses the same `drainWakeKeys` function so an auto-skip only fires on real keys.
- **Mouse button click triggers on UP, not DOWN** - `PeekConsoleInput` handler now tracks LMB DOWN→UP transitions using `$script:LButtonWasDown`. DOWN: detects the button under the cursor and immediately paints it in onclick colors via `Write-ButtonImmediate`. UP over button: triggers action (`$script:ConsoleClickCoords`). UP outside button (drag-off): 100ms delay then `Write-ButtonImmediate` with normal colors — no action fires.
- **Menu render loop uses per-button colors** - Before rendering each item (regular menu, quit, hidden `(h)`), the render resolves local color variables by checking `$script:PressedMenuButton` against the button's hotkey. Pressed button renders with `onClickFg`/`onClickBg`/`onClickHotkeyFg`; all others use their normal colors.
- **Popup buttons persist onclick color while dialog is open; toggle buttons restore immediately** - On confirmed click (UP over button), `$script:PendingDialogCheck = $true` is set. The menu render loop checks this flag: if no dialog is open, clears `$script:PressedMenuButton` immediately. For popup-opening actions the dialog is blocking; when it closes the next render fires the restore.
- **Resize UI defers exit while LMB is held** - All resize exit points now check `GetAsyncKeyState(0x01)` after the stability timer expires. If LMB is still held the exit is deferred (timer not reset). Exits the moment the mouse is released.

### Fixed
- **Resize screen triggered immediately on every startup** - `$oldWindowSize` was `$null` before the first main loop iteration, making `$windowSizeChanged` always `$true`. Fixed by initializing both tracking variables to the live window/buffer size just before the main loop.
- **Welcome screen dismissed prematurely after resize** - `Send-ResizeExitWakeKey` injects a synthetic `VK_RMENU` keypress to re-engage Windows Terminal mouse routing. That injected key landed in the console input buffer and caused `KeyAvailable` to return `$true`, making the welcome screen exit as if the user pressed a real key. Fixed via `drainWakeKeys` and explicit VK_RMENU filtering in the keypress check.
- **Resize not detected during welcome screen** - The original welcome screen only compared sizes and redrew its own content; it never entered the resize handler so the logo never appeared. Now calls `Invoke-ResizeHandler` when a size change is detected.
- **User mouse movement ignored during automated movement animation** - The movement animation loop ran to completion without checking for user mouse input. Now checks actual cursor position after each step; if drifted >3px the animation aborts, sets `$script:userInputDetected`, skips the simulated keypress, and starts the auto-resume timer.
- **Welcome screen resize detection never worked (root causes fully diagnosed and fixed via `_diag/welcome.txt`)**:
  - `getSize` (and `handleResize` inner loop) switched from `$Host.UI.RawUI.WindowSize` to direct Win32 `GetConsoleScreenBufferInfo` P/Invoke on the stdout handle, bypassing all managed caching layers.
  - `Restore-ConsoleInputMode` + `Send-ResizeExitWakeKey` now called once before the polling loop starts to prime Windows Terminal's input routing.
  - `drainWakeKeys` completely rewritten (see Changed section).
- **Welcome screen dismissed itself immediately without user input** - Three compounding bugs in the original `drainWakeKeys`: (1) it returned early on the first non-165 key (stale Enter KeyUp from script launch), leaving the synthetic Alt KeyDown in the buffer; (2) `VK_RMENU` (165) is reported as `VK_MENU` (18) by the Windows console input layer — the old 165-only filter missed it entirely; (3) `ReadKey("IncludeKeyDown")` blocks indefinitely on KeyUp events, causing the entire poll loop to freeze on tick 1. All three fixed by the rewritten `drainWakeKeys`.

### Changed
- **`drainWakeKeys` (nested in `Show-StartupComplete`) completely rewritten** - Now drains the entire input buffer on every call (no early return). Uses `IncludeKeyDown,IncludeKeyUp` to prevent blocking on KeyUp events. Filters all modifier VKs: 16 (Shift), 17 (Ctrl), 18 (VK_MENU / synthetic Alt), 160–165 (L/R Shift, Ctrl, Alt variants). Returns `$true` only for a non-modifier `KeyDown=true` event. The `$_wakeVKs` filter array is defined in the enclosing `Show-StartupComplete` scope and accessed via PowerShell's dynamic scoping.
- **`getSize` (nested in `Show-StartupComplete`) rewritten** - Now calls `[mJiggAPI.Mouse]::GetConsoleScreenBufferInfo` on `GetStdHandle(-11)` (stdout) directly and derives width/height from `srWindow`. Falls back to `$Host.UI.RawUI.WindowSize` only if the P/Invoke fails.
- **`handleResize` inner polling loop** - Also uses `GetConsoleScreenBufferInfo` directly (reuses a pre-allocated `$_hrCsbi` struct per invocation) rather than `$Host.UI.RawUI.WindowSize`.

### Added
- **`_diag/welcome.txt` always-on diagnostic** - `Show-StartupComplete` always writes a timestamped diagnostic log to `Start-mJig/_diag/welcome.txt` (no `-Diag` flag required). Logs every `getSize` call with raw CSBI values vs PS-host values, every `drainWakeKeys` event read, `KeyAvailable` state, resize detection transitions, and `handleResize`/`drawCompleteScreen` entry/exit points. Read with: `Get-Content "c:\Projects\mJigg\Start-mJig\_diag\welcome.txt"`

## [cee9bf8] - 2026-02-22

### Commit Message
"VT100 flicker-free rendering, clickable buttons via PeekConsoleInput, buffered frame output"

Changes since commit 4ddbfc2 ("Evidence-based input detection, security hardening, scroll/mouse hook removal"):

### Added
- `$script:MenuClickHotkey` - Script-scoped variable for menu click hotkey (was previously used but never initialized)
- `$script:ConsoleClickCoords` - Script-scoped variable storing character cell X/Y from the last left-click detected via `PeekConsoleInput` MOUSE_EVENT records
- **Mouse click detection via PeekConsoleInput** - Main loop, Time dialog, Movement dialog, and Quit dialog all detect left-button clicks by reading native `MOUSE_EVENT` records from the console input buffer. The console provides exact character cell coordinates, eliminating all pixel-to-character math.
- **Movement dialog field click selection** - Clicking on a field row in the Modify Movement dialog now switches the active field to the clicked row, redraws only the affected rows (no flicker), and positions the cursor at the end of that field's input
- **Quit dialog Yes/No button click support** - The quit confirmation dialog now responds to mouse clicks on the Yes and No buttons
- **Buffered frame rendering** - `Write-Buffer`, `Flush-Buffer`, `Clear-Buffer` functions and `$script:RenderQueue` (`System.Collections.Generic.List[hashtable]`). All UI rendering now writes to an in-memory queue first, then flushes to the console in a single burst per frame.
- **VT100/ANSI single-write rendering** - `Flush-Buffer` builds a single string with embedded VT100 escape sequences (cursor positioning, color changes, cursor visibility) via `StringBuilder`, then outputs the entire frame with one `[Console]::Write()` call. Eliminates 55-80 separate `Write-Host` calls per frame.
- **VT100 processing enabled on stdout** - `ENABLE_VIRTUAL_TERMINAL_PROCESSING` (0x0004) enabled on the output handle via `SetConsoleMode` during console setup
- **UTF-8 console encoding** - `[Console]::OutputEncoding` set to `[System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8` for correct emoji rendering via `[Console]::Write()`
- **ConsoleColor-to-ANSI mapping tables** - `$script:AnsiFG` and `$script:AnsiBG` hashtables mapping all 16 `[ConsoleColor]` values to ANSI SGR codes (30-37/90-97 for FG, 40-47/100-107 for BG)
- **`$script:CursorVisible` tracking variable** - Tracks cursor visibility state for conditional cursor show/hide in VT100 sequences
- **`$script:ESC` variable** - Stores `[char]27` for VT100 escape sequence construction
- **`-ClearFirst` switch on `Flush-Buffer`** - Embeds `ESC[2J` (clear screen) in the VT100 string for atomic clear+redraw with no visible flash
- **`-ClearFirst` switch on `Draw-ResizeLogo`** - Passes through to `Flush-Buffer -ClearFirst`
- **Hidden view `(h)` button** - Clickable button in bottom-right corner of hidden mode, behaves like the hide_output toggle

### Changed
- **All rendering paths use buffered output** - Header, separators, log entries, stats box, menu bar, all three dialogs (Time, Movement, Quit), dialog shadows, field redraws, resize logo, and dialog cleanup all write through `Write-Buffer` instead of directly to the console. `Flush-Buffer` is called at well-defined frame boundaries.
- **Emoji positions computed statically** - Menu bar, header, and dialog button rows no longer read `$Host.UI.RawUI.CursorPosition.X` after writing emojis. Instead, positions are calculated mathematically (emoji = 2 display cells), and menu item bounds (`$script:MenuItemsBounds`) are tracked by arithmetic rather than cursor position reads.
- **Click detection architecture** - Replaced the previous `GetAsyncKeyState` + `Get-MousePosition` + screen-pixel-to-character-cell conversion approach with native console input buffer events. `PeekConsoleInput` reads `MOUSE_EVENT` records which provide exact character cell coordinates directly from the console.
- **Left-button guard added** - Click-to-button mapping in the main loop only processes left button presses (dwButtonState & 0x0001), preventing accidental menu triggers from other mouse buttons.
- **Debug mode gate removed** - Click detection logic now runs in all modes, not just when `$DebugMode` is enabled. Debug logging remains conditional.
- **Simplified hit-testing** - All click detection now uses simple character cell comparisons. No pixel math, tolerance percentages, or expanded bounding boxes.
- **Cursor visibility via VT100** - All `[Console]::CursorVisible` assignments replaced with VT100 `ESC[?25l`/`ESC[?25h` sequences and `$script:CursorVisible` tracking. `Flush-Buffer` conditionally shows cursor at end of frame based on tracked state.
- **Default colors use ANSI 39/49** - Segments without explicit FG/BG colors emit ANSI "default foreground" (39) and "default background" (49) codes instead of mapping console's current color, preserving the terminal's true default/transparent background.
- **Atomic screen clear+redraw** - All `Clear-Host` + rendering pairs replaced with `Flush-Buffer -ClearFirst`, embedding the screen clear in the VT100 string so clear and redraw happen in a single `[Console]::Write()` call with no visible blank flash. Affects resize logo, dialog resize, and hidden view.
- **Hidden view clears old menu bounds** - `$script:MenuItemsBounds` cleared when entering hidden mode so old buttons are not clickable.

### Removed
- `Convert-ScreenToConsole` function - Screen pixel to console cell conversion (replaced by PeekConsoleInput native coords)
- `Test-ClickInBounds` function - Pixel-based hit-test with tolerance expansion (replaced by exact cell matching)
- `Get-ConsoleWindowHandle` function - Cached window handle lookup (no longer needed without pixel conversion)
- `$script:CachedConsoleHandle`, `$script:LastClickDebug`, `$script:ClickTolerancePct` variables
- `RECT` struct, `ScreenToClient`, `GetWindowRect`, `GetClientRect` P/Invoke declarations
- `CONSOLE_FONT_INFOEX` struct, `GetCurrentConsoleFontEx` P/Invoke declaration
- `ReadConsoleOutputAttribute` and `WriteConsoleOutputAttribute` P/Invoke declarations (unused remnants from previous emoji background fix attempt)
- All `[Console]::CursorVisible` references (replaced by VT100 sequences)
- Segment merging optimization in `Flush-Buffer` (no longer needed -- VT100 color changes are just bytes in the string, not separate API calls)
- Separate `Clear-Host` calls before rendering (replaced by `-ClearFirst` flag)

### Fixed
- **Clickable menu buttons not working** - The entire click-to-button coordinate conversion pipeline was gated behind `if ($DebugMode)`, making click detection silently fail in normal operation. Replaced with always-on PeekConsoleInput approach.
- **Undefined `$gotCursorPos` variable** - The main loop checked `if ($gotCursorPos)` which was never defined, causing coordinate conversion to always be skipped.
- **`$mousePoint` vs `$mousePos` variable mismatch** - Code retrieved mouse position into `$mousePos` but attempted to read from `$mousePoint`, which was never populated.
- **Quit dialog click detection** - `$keyProcessed` and `$char` were reset immediately after being set by `$script:DialogButtonClick`, wiping out the click result.
- **Click detection broke after Modify Movement dialog** - Added `$script:DialogButtonBounds = $null` cleanup on dialog close.
- **Window resize triggered quit dialog** - Resolved by switching to PeekConsoleInput, which only fires MOUSE_EVENT records when the console is focused.
- **Button bounds tightened to visible characters** - Click areas now correspond exactly to rendered emoji+pipe+text characters.
- **UI strobing/flicker** - Replaced 55-80 `Write-Host` calls per frame with single VT100 `[Console]::Write()` call, reducing frame render time from 55-160ms to sub-millisecond.
- **Grey background on default areas** - VT100 renderer now uses ANSI code 49 (default background) instead of mapping `[Console]::BackgroundColor` to an explicit color.
- **Emoji background on 2-column emoji** - `Write-Buffer -Wide` appends a trailing space with the background color for wide emojis; the explicit pipe positioning overwrites the space.
- **Hidden view resize crash** - `SetCursorPosition` out-of-bounds during resize replaced by VT100 positioning (no exception possible).
- **Hidden view strobing** - Full-frame clear+redraw now atomic via `Flush-Buffer -ClearFirst`.

## [4ddbfc2] - 2026-02-21

### Commit Message
"Evidence-based input detection, security hardening, scroll/mouse hook removal"

Changes since commit 3f27144 ("still working towords initial release"):

### Added
- `mJiggAPI.LASTINPUTINFO` struct, `GetLastInputInfo`, and `GetTickCount64` P/Invoke for passive system-wide input detection
- `mJiggAPI.KEY_EVENT_RECORD` struct for reading keyboard events from the console input buffer
- `KEY_EVENT_RECORD` overlay added to `INPUT_RECORD` union (at FieldOffset 4, alongside MouseEvent)
- `PeekConsoleInput`-based keyboard event detection -- reads KEY_EVENT records (EventType 0x0001) from the console input buffer to provide evidence-based keyboard detection without scanning key codes
- `PeekConsoleInput`-based scroll wheel detection -- reads MOUSE_EVENT records with scroll flag (EventType 0x0002, dwEventFlags 0x0004)
- Mouse movement inference via `GetLastInputInfo` -- when system activity is detected but no keyboard, scroll, or click evidence exists, it is classified as mouse movement
- Console input buffer flush after simulated keypress to prevent stale Right Alt events from being detected as user keyboard input
- `_diag/input.txt` diagnostic log for PeekConsoleInput + GetLastInputInfo detection
- `.gitignore` to exclude `_diag/` folder and backup files from git

### Changed
- **Input Detection Architecture**: Complete overhaul of input classification. All input types are now evidence-based:
  - **Keyboard**: Detected via `PeekConsoleInput` KEY_EVENT records (filtered for simulated VK 0xA5). Only peeked, not consumed, so menu hotkey handler can still read them.
  - **Scroll**: Detected via `PeekConsoleInput` MOUSE_EVENT with scroll flag. Consumed to prevent buffer buildup.
  - **Mouse clicks**: Detected via `GetAsyncKeyState` VK 0x01-0x06 (unchanged).
  - **Mouse movement**: Detected via `Test-MouseMoved` position polling or inferred by `GetLastInputInfo` when no other input type explains the activity.
  - **`GetLastInputInfo`**: No longer infers "keyboard" -- only sets `$script:userInputDetected` and infers mouse movement by elimination.
- **Mouse movement display label**: Changed from emoji (🐀) to text "Mouse" in the detected inputs display
- **Scroll/Input Detection**: Replaced system-wide low-level mouse hook (`WH_MOUSE_LL` / `mJiggAPI.MouseHook`) with `PeekConsoleInput` + `GetLastInputInfo`-based detection. Uses `GetTickCount64` for 64-bit tick math to avoid overflow on systems with >24.9 days uptime.
- **Diagnostics folder**: Moved from `$env:TEMP\mjig_diag\` to `_diag/` relative to the script location, so agents and users can access logs directly in the project directory
- Resize quote color changed from `DarkGray` to `White`

### Removed
- `mJiggAPI.MouseHook` class and all associated P/Invoke definitions (`SetWindowsHookEx`, `UnhookWindowsHookEx`, `CallNextHookEx`, `GetModuleHandle`, `PeekMessage`, `MSG`, `MSLLHOOKSTRUCT`, `LowLevelMouseProc`)
- `$PreviousMouseWheelDelta` tracking variable (no longer needed)
- Mouse hook install/uninstall/ProcessMessages calls from initialization, debug pause, and main loop
- Keyboard inference from `GetLastInputInfo` -- the flawed "if not mouse, must be keyboard" logic has been removed entirely

### Fixed
- Mouse cursor lag during debug "press any key" pause and potentially during busy main loop sections, caused by `WH_MOUSE_LL` hook starving the system message pump
- False "Keyboard" labels appearing when only mouse movement or scroll wheel was used -- caused by `GetLastInputInfo` incorrectly defaulting to keyboard when `Test-MouseMoved` had brief polling gaps
- Menu hotkeys not responding -- `PeekConsoleInput` was consuming KEY_EVENT records from the buffer before the menu hotkey handler (`$Host.UI.RawUI.ReadKey`) could read them. Fixed by only peeking (not consuming) keyboard events.

### Security
- **Removed `Get-KeyName` function** -- eliminated VK-code-to-name mapping table that security scanners flag as keylogger pattern
- **Removed full 256-code `GetAsyncKeyState` keyboard scan** -- the `for ($keyCode = 0; $keyCode -le 255; ...)` loop that polled every virtual key code every ~50ms has been replaced with a focused mouse-button-only loop (VK 0x01-0x06)
- **Removed `GetAsyncKeyState` from `Keyboard` class** -- the API is now only exposed in the `Mouse` class, reducing the P/Invoke surface
- **Removed `PressedKeys` real-time display scan** -- the secondary 256-code scan that populated real-time key state for the stats box has been removed entirely
- **Keyboard detection now evidence-based** -- `$keyboardInputDetected` is set only when actual KEY_EVENT records are found in the console input buffer via `PeekConsoleInput`. No key identity is captured beyond filtering the simulated VK 0xA5.
- **Stats box shows categories, not key names** -- "Detected Inputs" now displays `Mouse`, `Keyboard`, `LButton`, `Scroll/Other` etc. instead of specific key names like `A, LShift, Space`
- **Removed `$PressedKeys` and `$intervalKeys`** -- variables that accumulated specific key names are removed; only boolean flags and category labels remain
